[Advent of Code -- 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

My first year attempting to do this. Have been (lightly) learning Elixir recently so a goal of this was to get through the month with that to learn more and get some experience solving problems in it.

I sometimes refactor my code for star 2 after getting a correct submission but star 1 functions are always left as is since I don't have the motivation to clean up or improve the easy version of the problem. Normaly I refactor star 2 code in place but I split it out to a new `star2_refactored` method if I refactored based on spoilers from conversations or peaking at solution threads (only ever after getting the correct answer on my own from my initial approach) so that my initial self-found approach can be preserved in-line.
